### What is ThinkPads.org?

We are a small community of developers, testers and package maintainers who are
developing drivers and background services for your Lenovo ThinkPad.
We build software that makes your life using your ThinkPad on Linux systems a breeze.

There are a couple of projects already there and many planned.

Here are the currently published projects:

- [dockd - Dock Management Daemon](/projects/dockd)
- [libthinkpad - General Userspace ThinkPad Library](/projects/libthinkpad)
