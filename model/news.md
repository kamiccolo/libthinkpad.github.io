## dockd version 1.20 released

This is the first public release of dockd that has been tested locally and is open to public testing on other platforms.    
The library and executable have been tested on a ThinkpPad X220 and a Ultrabase Series 3, and are expected to work on any    
pre-XX40 series laptop and dock.     
    
In order to support laptops and docks after the XX40 series (including the P50/51/T450+) we need people who can dedicate their    
time and hardware to get it developed and tested.    
    
If you are willing to spare some time to test new hardware you can find me over at Freenode in #ibmthinkpad or contact me via    
email and we will meet on IRC.

Changelog:

* Removed udev dependency and mirgrated triggering to libthinkpad
* Added support for switching display modes when waking/sleeping the ThinkPad
* First public release


Any bugs can be reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/libthinkpad/dockd/issues).
