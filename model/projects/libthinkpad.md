This library was created to abstract away all Lenovo ThinkPad-specific hardware like the docks and the ThinkLight. This library
provides advanced features to software projects using it specific to Lenovo ThinkPad Laptops directly from the userspace.

This was created to avoid manual crawling of sysfs entries and udev rule filterings by each executable individually.
All ThinkPads.org use this library in some way.
