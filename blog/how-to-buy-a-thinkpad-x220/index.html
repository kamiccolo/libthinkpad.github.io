    <h3>Why the X220?</h3>
<p>The Thinkpad X220 is the last generation of the 12-inch portable by Lenovo that.<br />
features the old 7 row keyboard that IBM designed and used since the 1990's.<br />
The keyboard was so good, that people actually retrofitted the keyboard to the <br />
X230 series of laptops, to squeeze more performance out of them but still retain <br />
the old keyboard. <br />
<a href="https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec">More info here.</a><br />
In this guide I will point out key points to watch out when buying a used X220.</p>
<h3>Should I buy one on eBay?</h3>
<p>I'm very skeptical about ThinkPads from eBay, but the folks from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad">/r/thinkpad</a> <br />
usually have great success with these machines. It's usually a company wanting <br />
to upgrade their hardware so the sell the old equipment on eBay.<br />
If you buy one on eBay and it arrives faulty, damaged or the description of the <br />
product you received does not match the ad, eBay usually has your back and <br />
will force the seller to perform a refund. That is if you are not in a third-world<br />
country.</p>
<h3>Assertion list</h3>
<p>Let's start with the actual guide. I designed this guide to be like a software <br />
unit test, if all assertions pass the check the machine is good! Let's start.</p>
<h4>Is the BIOS locked? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Power on the machine, press the F1 key when you see the ThinkPad logo. <br />
The machine shall not ask for a password and shall enter the BIOS without any <br />
further interaction. All settings in the BIOS shall be accessible.</strong> <br><br />
As these machines usually come from companies, their IT departments don't remove<br />
the BIOS supervisor passwords that some IT departments enforce on the machines.<br />
This is a problem for buyers that buy these machines from these companies.<br />
If the BIOS is password-protected, you are severely limited in the functionality<br />
of the machine, as installing new operating systems can be a hard or virtually impossible.<br />
You also loose the ability to switch between UEFI and Legacy, change virtualization<br />
options, turn of Anti-Theft, the possibility to clear the TPM, and more.<br />
If a machine asks for a password, the password can be avoided by pressing the Escape key,<br />
and you can enter the limited BIOS and look around, and change some basic settings.<br />
The password can be removed by opening the machine and shorting the SDA and SCL pins on the<br />
EEPROM chip that holds the password.<br />
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/3jin77/x220_and_bios_password/">More info here.</a></p>
<h4>Are the hinges in good condition? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Open the laptop lid to a position of 90 degrees in respect to the keyboard. <br />
Put your finger on the top of the lid, and move back and forth using a moderate amount <br />
of force. The lid shall not move back and forth, until you reach the hinge force threshold <br />
to move the lid.</strong> <br><br />
Some ThinkPads like the T61/T60/T400 have a notorious problem with the hinges, in which they<br />
develop play over time. This is really annoying, as the screen jolts around when you carry<br />
the laptop around.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBUs2_ueX78">Here is a video demonstrating the issue.</a><br />
This is impossible to fix permanently, as replacing the hinges only results in<br />
the new hinges developing play.</p>
<h4>Do all keys on the keyboard work? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Navigate to <a href="http://www.keyboardtester.com/">keyboardtester.com</a> using any Web browser, press<br />
the "Launch the Tester" button. Press all the keys on the ThinkPad keyboard. All the keys shall <br />
function normally, shall not stick and shall rebound normally. The keys shall not produce any loud clicking noises.</strong> <br><br />
People usually sell these machines after spillages. Stuck or dead keys is a dead giveaway for this.</p>
<h4>Does the keyboard smell like any liquid product? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Pick the machine up and smell the keyboard. The keyboard shall not smell like any <br />
liquid product, like coffee, milk or tea.</strong> <br><br />
This is also a test for spillages, as getting the smell out of the machine is really hard<br />
after a spillage of liquid products, like milk, tea or coffee.</p>
<h4>Is the top cover of the lid cracked? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Open the laptop lid to a position of 90 degrees in respect to the keyboard. Pull the <br />
top part of the lid towards the keyboard with a little amount of force. The cover shall<br />
not separate from the lid.</strong> <br><br />
The top lid of the X220 consists of 2 parts, a magnesium lower part and a plastic cover.<br />
The plastic cover is there for the antennas to have better reception.<br />
This lid is know to crack and separate.<br />
<a href="https://lnv.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/8953iA74F595A2D94FA7C?v=1.0">Picture of the problem.</a></p>
<h4>Is the plastic above the ExpressCard slot cracked? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Remove any ExpressCard cards. Put your finger in the middle of the slot and apply force<br />
until the plastic flexes 2 millimeters. The plastic shall not have any cracks in it.</strong> <br><br />
The plastic above the ExpressCard slot is thin and tends to crack, because people pick the<br />
laptop up from this corner when they carry it and put the thumb on this part, transferring all the wight to this corner of the machine.</p>
<h4>Is a ExpressCard cover door present? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Remove any ExpressCard cards. There shall be a small plastic door covering the slot.</strong> <br><br />
As the plastic above the ExpressCard slot is thin, and when people carry the machine the plastic<br />
flexes so much that it snaps the ExpressCard slot cover in half.<br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/t8zjB">Picture of a cracked cover.</a><br />
This can be harmless, but also can be dangerous, because the little spring that closes<br />
the cover can still be inside the machine and cause shorts.</p>
<h4>Does the battery have under 300 cycles?</h4>
<p><strong>Boot a live Ubuntu Linux distribution and run the following command inside a Terminal.</strong> <br><br />
<code>upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0</code><br />
<strong>The cycle count shall be under 300.</strong> <br><br />
Any battery that has around 300 cycles can be considered worn, and you can expect<br />
about 1.5 hours of battery life from these batteries after a gauge reset or a dead battery<br />
with no gauge reset.</p>
<h4>If equipped with an IPS display, are there any pressure spots on the screen? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Open a image or program with an all-white background. The screen shall not <br />
have any visible bright white spots on it.</strong> <br><br />
IPS displays are known to develop so-called "pressure spots". That happens when<br />
pressure is applied to a IPS panel and the display develops a white spot.<br />
<a href="https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/6560891_f496.jpg">Picture of pressure spots on older ThinkPad.</a><br />
To fix this, the whole panel needs to be replaced.</p>
<h4>Does the machine overheat? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Do a synthetic stress test on the machine using Prime95 or some other software.<br />
The CPU temperature shall not exceed 95±5 degrees Celsius and shall not throttle. <br />
The machine shall not power off.</strong> <br><br />
These machines have a powerful 35W CPU and run hot by design when stressed, but it<br />
 does not thermal-throttle.<br />
Temperatures can be fixed by changing the thermal compound to a higher quality one.<br />
A machine is considered bad if it overheats past 100 degrees Celsius, it powers<br />
off to protect itself or it throttles badly.</p>
<h4>Does the drive pass a S.M.A.R.T check? (Yes/No)</h4>
<p><strong>Use CrystalDiskInfo to check the S.M.A.R.T data of the drive. <br />
There shall be no errors or warnings.</strong> <br><br />
Drives can fail over time or if they are dropped. S.M.A.R.T data gives this away.</p>
<h3>Do a general check of the machine</h3>
<p>After you pass this assertion list, do a general function check of the machine. <br />
Verify that everything works, all ports function and the OS boots and does not crash under stress.</p>
<h3>Note about Ricoh card readers and Windows 10</h3>
<p>If you notice that the machine runs hot and it's running Windows 10, the problem is the <br />
Ricoh SD/MMC card reader driver. Ricoh has not released a Windows 10 driver for this <br />
machine, and the old Windows 7 driver causes Wndows 10 to stay at around 50% <br />
of CPU usage, and the machine runs really hot.<br />
This can be confirmed by taking a look at Task Manager. If the "System" task under <br />
the "Details" tab is using 30-50% of CPU, that's the problem.<br />
To fix this, navigate to the Device Manager and disable the card reader under <br />
Storage Controllers. You should almost immediately feel the machine get cooler <br />
and hear the fan spinning down. </p>
<h3>Don't feel like you are causing the seller a distress by doing extensive tests</h3>
<p>Don't rush! The seller will rather spend an hour selling the machine then have it returned <br />
or receive bad calls afterwards. <em><strong>Take your time.</strong></em></p>
